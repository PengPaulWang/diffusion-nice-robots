I'm a CS graduate student at the [Weizmann Institute Of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages), where I'm advised by [Prof. Michal Irani](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/irani). My research interests revolve around Deep Learning and studying the properties of neural networks, with a focus on memorization and unlearning.

Prior to that, I've worked as a software engineer in the industry and received my B.Sc, Summa cum Laude.
